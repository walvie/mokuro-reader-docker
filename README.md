## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

You can access the reader at [reader.mokuro.app](https://reader.mokuro.app/).

**To import manga:**

1. Process your manga with mokuro (see requirements below)
2. Upload the processed folder or ZIP containing your manga images and the `.mokuro` file
3. Start reading!

**Requirements:** Mokuro version `0.2.0` or later is required to generate the `.mokuro` file.

```bash
pip install mokuro
```

### Cloud Sync Setup

Connect to **Google Drive**, **MEGA**, **OneDrive**, or **WebDAV** from the Cloud page in settings (a **Local Folder** option is also available on desktop Chromium browsers). All providers support:

- Automatic progress and profile sync across devices
- Volume backup with one-tap restore on other devices
- Cloud-only volumes appear as downloadable placeholders in your catalog
- High-speed series backup and downloads using web workers

### Reading Speed Features

The reader automatically tracks your reading speed and provides:

- **Real-time speed** displayed during reading
- **Historical graphs** showing speed trends over time
- **Time estimates** for finishing current volume and series
- **Achievements** for reaching reading milestones

### Text Analysis

Each volume and series has a dedicated text analysis page:

- View all text extracted from the manga
- Useful for vocabulary mining with browser extensions like Yomitan
- Analyze character frequency across series

## 🛠 Development

### Requirements

- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- npm

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gnathonic/mokuro-reader
cd mokuro-reader
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

### Environment Variables

For Google Drive and/or OneDrive integration, create a `.env` file:

```env
VITE_GDRIVE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
VITE_GDRIVE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_ONEDRIVE_CLIENT_ID=your_azure_app_client_id
```

For OneDrive, register an Azure AD app ("common" authority) and add your deploy
origin as a **Single-page application** redirect URI. When unset, the OneDrive
option is hidden. MEGA, WebDAV, and Local Folder need no configuration.

## 🐳 Self-Hosting with Docker

Mokuro Reader is a fully client-side app (by default, all data lives in your
browser's IndexedDB), so self-hosting mostly just means serving the static
build — the included `Dockerfile` builds it and serves it with nginx. An
optional second service can also serve a manga library straight from a
mounted folder on the host, without importing anything into the browser —
see [Self-hosted server library](#-self-hosted-server-library) below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gnathonic/mokuro-reader
cd mokuro-reader
docker compose up -d --build
```

The app is then available at `http://localhost:8080`. Set `PORT` to use a
different host port.

To enable Google Drive and/or OneDrive sync, copy `.env.example` to `.env`
and fill in the values described above, then restart the container:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env
docker compose up -d
```

These are applied when the container starts (via `docker/docker-entrypoint.sh`),
so changing `.env` and restarting is enough — no image rebuild required.

### 📚 Self-hosted server library

If your manga collection already lives on the server (a NAS, a home server,
etc.), you don't have to upload it into every browser's storage. A second
Docker service, `library-server`, can serve the collection directly from a
mounted host folder — the reader fetches pages over HTTP on demand, and
nothing is copied into IndexedDB.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set MANGA_LIBRARY_PATH to an absolute host path, e.g.
#   MANGA_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/storage/manga
docker compose up -d --build
```

Volumes appear in the catalog alongside anything you've imported normally,
marked read-only (no edit/delete/export — there's no local copy to change).
Progress, settings, and stats work exactly as they do for any other volume,
since those are already stored in your browser regardless of where a
volume's pages come from.

**Supported layout**: any folder structure the normal drag-and-drop import
already understands — `Series/Volume.mokuro` + `Series/Volume/` images,
mokuro sitting inside the image folder, nested series directories, TOC-style
chapter subfolders, or plain image-only folders with no `.mokuro` at all.
Unlike normal import, the library server only reads already-extracted
directories — `.zip`/`.cbz` archives placed directly in the library are not
opened.

**Picking up new manga**: the library is scanned once at container startup.
After adding or removing files, either restart the service —
`docker compose restart library-server` — or trigger a rescan without a
restart:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/rescan
```

Set `LIBRARY_RESCAN_INTERVAL_MINUTES` in `.env` to have it rescan
automatically on a schedule instead.

Leave `MANGA_LIBRARY_PATH` unset and this service just serves an empty
library — everything else works normally.
